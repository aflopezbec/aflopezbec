### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is AndrÃ©s LÃ³pez

### Flutter developer | Android Developer | iOS Developer

ðŸŽ¯ Software Engineer | Mobile Developer | 7+ years of experience | Technical leadership and mentorship

Software Engineer with extensive experience in developing technology products, particularly mobile applications for iOS and Android. I specialize in technologies such as Flutter, native Android (Kotlin, Java), and Swift, but I am also capable of contributing at any stage of a product's lifecycle, from concept and design to implementation and maintenance.

I have successfully led projects from inception to deployment, collaborating on defining user stories, designing robust architectures, and delivering continuous improvements to optimize the user experience. Additionally, I have experience managing multidisciplinary teams and fostering collaboration, allowing for the efficient resolution of complex problems. 

I am enthusiastic about strengthening the team's skills through mentoring, providing technical guidance and support in key areas such as communication, teamwork, and decision-making. This enhances their growth and performance as software developers while simultaneously improving overall productivity, which also contributes to my own professional development.
